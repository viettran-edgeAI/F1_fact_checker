| `x-loc-state-name` | header | string | No | The name of the client's state/region.                 The region is the first-level subdivision (the broadest or least specific) of the                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2">ISO 3166-2</a> code. |
| `x-loc-country` | header | string | No | The two letter country code for the client's country.                 For a list of country codes,                 see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2</a> |

| `cache-control` | header | string | No | Brave Search will return cached content by default.                 To prevent caching set the Cache-Control header to `no-cache`.                 This is currently done as best effort. |
| `user-agent` | header | string | No | The user agent originating the request.                 Brave search can utilize the user agent to provide a different                 experience depending on the device as described by the string.                 The user agent should follow the commonly used browser agent                 strings on each platform. For more information on curating user agents,                 see [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-user-agent). |
